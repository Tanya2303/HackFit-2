## 📂 Best Use of Appwrite

We are utilising Appwrite to create our backend. The data from the user chat is kept in **Appwrite's database**. **Appwrite's Storage** is also used to store the daily calorie intake. We employ **Appwrite's Authentication** to verify the users' identities. With Appwrite, building our backend was really straightforward. Because of the free plan, we learned how robust and speedy Appwrite's services are, which was great for us student hackers.
